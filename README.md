mesosphere
==========

Mesosphere is a little bundle of django-based fun for making personal web sites.

It's easy to use and set up if you know a bit of python, and/or html. It's not really the right tool
for you if you don't. I'm trying to make something that's easy to use and stays out of your way,
without bothering with the lowest-common-denominator type features.

Why?
----

Wondering why I didn't just use mezzanine? For this project, I wanted it really small and simple,
with even less features, and an even smaller code base to tinker with. And certainly no web based
meta-admin (Hi Drupal and Wordpress!). In the end, I made it for a web site of my own, but it's up
on github just in case anyone else wants to use the code for anything.

Dependencies
------------

* python 3.3+
* django 1.7+
* django floppyforms 1.1+
* pytz
* django-floppyforms-bootstrap3

Getting Started
---------------

TODO :p

(but it's the same as any ordinary django project really).
